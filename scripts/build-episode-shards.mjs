/**
 * Build per-title episode shards (streaming, dependency-free, low-memory).
 *
 * Reads the master src/data/generated/all.json and writes ONE small JSON file
 * per episodic title (series/anime with >1 episode) into public/_data/episodes/.
 *
 * Why shards: the SSR episode pages must NOT bundle the 86MB all.json (that OOMs
 * the build and blows the Cloudflare Worker size limit). Each title is emitted
 * as a PLAIN STATIC asset and fetched at request time, so a request only ever
 * pulls in the one title it needs. The shards carry the exact same Title objects
 * the static pages use, so episode content stays identical across the site.
 *
 * Why streaming: all.json is ~86MB. `JSON.parse(readFileSync(...))` peaks well
 * above 1GB and gets OOM-killed on small machines. Instead we walk the file as a
 * stream and carve out each top-level array element by tracking brace/bracket
 * depth (string- and escape-aware), parsing one Title object at a time. Peak
 * memory stays at roughly the size of a single title.
 *
 * Slugs can contain non-ASCII (Arabic) chars, so the on-disk filename is a
 * base64url of the UTF-8 slug; a manifest maps slug -> filename.
