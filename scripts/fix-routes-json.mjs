/**
 * Post-build fixer for dist/_routes.json (Cloudflare Pages function-routing).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * The @astrojs/cloudflare adapter auto-generates dist/_routes.json. Our site
 * mixes thousands of PRERENDERED (static) pages with a handful of SSR route
 * *shapes* that live under the same URL prefixes:
 *
 *   STATIC  : /                      (home)
 *             /f/<slug>              (movie detail)
 *             /d/<slug>  /d/<slug>/c/<season>     (series detail + season)
 *             /n/<slug>  /n/<slug>/c/<season>     (anime  detail + season)
 *             /x/...                 (listings)
 *             /search /contact /privacy /terms /404
 *
 *   SSR     : /d/<slug>/c/<season>/e/<episode>    (series episode)
 *             /n/<slug>/c/<season>/e/<episode>    (anime  episode)
 *             /w/...                 (new CSV works, all depths)
 *             /gw/<token> /g/<token> (streaming gateway)
 *             /x/c/<code>            (listing code resolver)
 *             /episodes-sitemap.xml  /episodes-sitemap/<n>.xml
 *             /_image  /_server-islands/*
 *
 * Because the static page count is far above Cloudflare's 100-rule limit, the
 * adapter falls back to `include: ["/*"]` with a TRUNCATED exclude list. That
 * routes EVERY request (every static page + asset) through the SSR Worker:
 *   - On the free plan this burns the daily Functions request quota fast
 *     (Googlebot alone was crawling ~4k/day), after which pages fail to serve
 *     and Google stops indexing.
 *   - Even when it serves, episode SSR pages compete for the same starved
 *     Worker, so "crawled - currently not indexed" piles up.
 *
 * THE FIX
 * -------
 * Write a precise _routes.json whose `include` lists ONLY the SSR prefixes.
 * Everything else is served as a pure static asset (unlimited + fast + correct
 * HTML), so the Worker is invoked solely for genuinely dynamic routes.
 *
 * Static /d/<slug> and /n/<slug> (and their /c/<season> pages) are NOT
 * renderable SSR routes in the Worker manifest, so when they DO hit the Worker
 * (they share the /d/* and /n/* include prefix with episodes) the adapter's
 * handler finds no matching route and falls through to env.ASSETS — i.e. the
 * static HTML is still served correctly. Keeping /d/* and /n/* in `include` is
 * required so the deeper episode URLs (which ARE SSR) are reachable.
 *
 * The resulting rule set is tiny (well under 100), so Cloudflare never
 * truncates it and the home page / movies / listings / assets are 100% static.
